# Rock vs Mine Classification

This is my **first Machine Learning project** where I implemented **Logistic Regression** to classify objects as either **Rock** or **Mine** based on sonar data.

## Overview
- **Problem:** Binary classification (Rock vs Mine)
- **Dataset:** Sonar dataset (input features from sonar signals)
- **Goal:** Predict whether an object is a Rock or a Mine

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Steps Implemented
1. Data preprocessing (handling features and labels)
2. Train-test split
3. Model training using Logistic Regression
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, predictions)

## Learning Outcome
- Understood logistic regression implementation
- Learned train-test split and model evaluation
- Hands-on experience with ML workflow in Python

## Status
Beginner-level learning project
